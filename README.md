# Memory game ðŸ§ 

## The Mission
We want to recreate the game `memory`. It is a game where  you have a bunch of cards. Each card contains an image. Of each image there are exactly two cards. The cards are placed in a random order. You get to turn them around. If you turned around two cards they either turn back, so you can't see their image if they did not match. If they did match they stay image face visible.
